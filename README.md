## ConnectSix
My first Android App! ConnectSix is a turn-based board game, played by two players.

## How to play
The objective of this game is to connect six of your pieces in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Each player takes turn to place two of their pieces. Except for the first turn, where the first player may only place one piece.
